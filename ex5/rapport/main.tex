\section{Introduction}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.55\textwidth}
 \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{graphs/schema.png}
 \caption{Geometry of the problem \cite{doc-cours}}
 \label{schema}
\end{wrapfigure}


This problem focuses on the propagation of heat in an homogeneous environment.
We consider two rectangular bodies of same height and respective temperatures $T_c = 200$°C and $T_f = -100$°C inside of a square box $\Omega$, of which the outside boundary is at temperature $T_b = 0$°C. Initially, the temperature of the inside of the box is $T(t=0) = T_b$. The problems satisfies the heat equation \eqref{heateq}:

\begin{equation}
 \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = D\nabla ^2 T
 \label{heateq}
\end{equation}
with $D=\kappa/(\rho C)$ a constant, where $\kappa=1.2~\si{\W \per \K \per \m}$ is the thermal conductivity, $\rho=1.2~\si{\kg \per \m^3}$ is the mass density, and $C=10^3~\si{\J \per \kg \per \K}$ is the specific heat capacity.


The geometry of the problem is as represented on Fig.\ref{schema}, where the parameters are: $L=10$ cm, $x_a=2$ cm, $x_b=4$ cm, $x_c=7.5$ cm, $x_d=8.5$ cm, $y_a=3$ cm, and $y_b=8$ cm. Numerically, the system is discretized as a $N\times N$ regular grid.

In this report, the evolution of the system with respect to time will be simulated in order to study the heat flux and thermal power of each body. The simulation is done using the Jacobi method.


\section{Convergence and stability}

A convergence study of the temperature with the time step $\Delta t$ was made for $N=40$ (Fig.\ref{fig:b-conv40}) and $N=80$ (Fig.\ref{fig:b-conv80}) at the center point (0.05,0.05) of the system using linear interpolation. In both cases the convergence seems linear, as expected from the Jacobi algorithm. %TODO : why ?

  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{Convergence study of the temperature for a varying $\Delta t$}
  \label{fig:bconv}
\end{figure}

The limit of stability in function of $\Delta t$ was also studied in both cases on Fig.\ref{fig:blim}. The limit of stability for $N=40$ is about $\Delta t = 1.61 \cdot 10^{-3}$ s, while the limit for $N=80$ is around $\Delta t = 3.95 \cdot 10^{-4}$ s. Thus we can observe that while a higher $N$ allows for better precision on the computed values, it has a much lower limit of stability. Using this information, all of the following simulations will be run using $N=40$ and a time step $\Delta t = \SI{1e-4}{\s}$.

\section{Heat flux}
This section focuses on the analysis of the behavious of the heat flux.
The heat flux is defined by equation \eqref{eq:flux-chaleur}.

\begin{equation}
  \vec{j} = -\kappa\vec{\nabla} T
  \label{eq:flux-chaleur}
\end{equation}

where $\kappa$ is the thermal conductivity.
By using a forward finite difference method, $\vec{j}$ can be numerically computed using equation \eqref{eq:flux-chaleur-numerique}.

\begin{equation}
  \vec{j} = -\frac{\kappa}{h}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    T^k_{i+1,j} - T^k_{i,j}, & T^k_{i,j+1} - T^k_{i,j}
  \end{pmatrix}
  \label{eq:flux-chaleur-numerique}
\end{equation}

At $t=\SI{0.1}{\s}$, with a stable $\Delta t$ and $N=40$, the flux heat can be seen in two ways, depending on the interest.
On figure \ref{fig:c-temp}, information about direction can be observed.
First, the temperature of the multiple points of the system can be studied using the color gradient.
These colors show the diffusion of heat through the homogeneous environment.
Next, the little arrows show the direction and the intensity of the heat flux.
As it can be observed, the heat flux goes from the hot source to a colder environment.
All of this can be explained by the second law of thermodynamics, which states that in a closed system, entropy never decreases. \cite{wiki:2nd-law}
Thus, the system tends to reach the thermodynamic equilibrum, and the heat diffuses.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{graphs/c_temp.eps}
  \caption{Graph of temperatures at $t=\SI{0.1}{\s}$, represented by the color gradient, in Kelvin, with the direction and the intensity of the heat flux represented by the arrows}
  \label{fig:c-temp}
\end{figure}

On figure \ref{fig:c-heat-flux}, the intensity of the heat flux can be observed using the color gradient.
The more yellow it gets, the higher the norm of the heat flux is. %TODO : Phrase pas très belle.
First, the graph shows indirectly the diffusion of heat through the environment.
When the intensity is lower, it either means that the environment is closer to thermodynamic equilibrum or that less heat is flowing. %TODO : Je sais pas si cette phrase a un intérêt, c'est évident.
But the most interesting point on this graph is the corners of the sources, in particular the hot source.
The majority of the environment has a norm for the heat flux around $\SI{10000}{\watt\per\square\meter}$. But on these corners, the norm of the heat flux reaches \SI{25000}{\watt\per\square\meter}.
This behaviour does not appear on the border of the heat sources, so it is different from a simple "diffusion", these are singularities. %TODO : C'est pas un peu fort.
This behaviour can be compared to the the \textit{peak effect} \footnote{The name of this effect is directly translated from the french expression: \textit{effet de pointe}. No real translation of this effect in english seems to exist.}, an effect in electrostatics that describes the concentration of charges on the peak of a conductor.
This comparison is not innocent, as there is a mathematical similarity between the electric field and the heat flux.
The electric field $\vec{E}$ is derived from a scalar potential $\phi$, the electric potential, which give equation \eqref{eq:elec-field}.

\begin{equation}
  \vec{E} = -\vec{\nabla}\phi
  \label{eq:elec-field}
\end{equation}

Equation \eqref{eq:elec-field} is similar to equation \eqref{eq:flux-chaleur}, as $\vec{j}$ is also derived from a scalar potential ($T$).
Thus, the peaks in intensity on the corners of the sources can be compared to the \textit{peak effect} of electrostatics.

\end{figure}

\section{Power study}
This section focuses on the study of the evolution of power emitted or received from both sources over time.
This power is measured using a closed surface, $S$ surrounding the zone of interest.
The power is defined by the surface integral stated by equation \eqref{eq:power}.

\begin{equation}
  P(t) = \iint_S \vec{j}(x,y,t)\cdot \text{d}\vec{\sigma}
  \label{eq:power}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Numerical integration method.}
This first paragraph focuses on the method used to numerically integrate, and thus obtain the power.
Figure \ref{fig:d-mailles} is a diagram representing a simplified version of the grid used in this project.
The crossings between the black lines are the temperatures, the yellow square is the source considered, the blue circles are the horizontal heat flux $j_x$ obtained with a centered finite difference method on horizontal axis, the green circles are the vertical heat flux $j_y$ obtained with a centered finite difference method on vertical axis, vectors d$\vec{\sigma}$ are represented by the arrows and finally the red square is the Gauss surface $S$ considered.\\
%TODO : Je dis pas trop de la merde ?
To approximate the integral, the problem needs to be discretized.
A surface integral can be seen as a continuous sum over a surface $S$.
Thus, in a discrete modelisation, which is the case here, the surface integral can be replaced by a sum over several point.
It adds some uncertainties, but it is really easy to compute.
Thus, the power can be found by adding $\vec{j}_i\cdot d\vec{\sigma}$ for each point contained on the border of the surface $S$, where d$\vec{\sigma} = h\hat{e}_i$ with $h$ the distance between two nodes.
Note that $\vec{j}_i$ and $\hat{e}_j$ are either parallel or perpendicular, which means that the scalar product $\vec{j}_i\cdot\hat{e}_j$ is $\pm j_i$ when $i=j$ or $0$ when $i \neq j$.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{graphs/d_mailles.eps}
  \caption{Diagram of the grid considered in this project}
  \label{fig:d-mailles}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Analytical proof of surfaces equivalence.}
On this second paragraph, a proof that $P_c + P_f = P_\text{tot}$ when $\frac{\partial T}{\partial t}\rightarrow 0$ will be described.

\begin{proof}
  The continuity equation is given by $\rho C\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} + \vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{j} = S \illabel{eq:continuity-with-T}$ where $S = S_c + S_f$ the sources.
  By hypothesis, $\frac{\partial T}{\partial t}\rightarrow 0$, which leads equation \eqref{eq:continuity-with-T} to this new equation: $\vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{j} = S_\text{tot} \illabel{eq:continuity-without-T}$.
  Use the definition of power over a surface $\Sigma_\text{tot}$ containing both sources.
  \begin{align}
    P_\text{tot} &= \iint_{\Sigma_\text{tot}}\vec{j}\cdot d\vec{\sigma} \\
    \intertext{By using Gauss' theorem}
    &= \iiint_{V_\text{tot}}\left(\vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{j}\right)dV  = \iiint_{V_\text{tot}}SdV \\
    \intertext{By using the fact that $V_\text{tot} = V_c + V_f + V_r$ where $V_c$ and $V_f$ are the volumes surrounding the hot and cold sources, and $V_r$ is the remaining volume. Thus:}
    &= \iiint_{V_c}SdV + \iiint_{V_f}SdV + \underbrace{\iiint_{V_r}SdV}_\text{$=0$ because it does not surround a source.} \\
    \intertext{Thus, by coming back to the power using Gauss' theorem again:}
    &= \iiint_{V_c}SdV + \iiint_{V_f}SdV = \iiint_{V_c}\left(\vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{j}\right)dV + \iiint_{V_f}\left(\vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{j}\right)dV \\
    &= \iint_{\Sigma_c}\vec{j}\cdot d\vec{\sigma} + \iint_{\Sigma_f}\vec{j}\cdot d\vec{\sigma} = P_c + P_f
  \end{align}
  which is $P_\text{tot} = P_c + P_f$.
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Numerical evolution of power.}
This last paragraph focuses on the numerical results obtained by using the numerical method described earlier.
For a simulation of $t=\SI{0.5}{\s}$, the evolution of the power is given by figure \ref{fig:d-power}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{graphs/d_power.eps}
  \caption{Evolution of power for \SI{0.5}{\s}}
  \label{fig:d-power}
\end{figure}

The first information to notice on this figure is amplitude of power.
At the beginning, the power is of order \SI{10}{\kilo\watt}, which can seem really high.
And after a moment, the stabilized power is of order \SI{1}{\kilo\watt}.
This seems too much for a simple heat transfert between two small sources, but it may have multiple explaination.
In the first \num{25} milliseconds, the difference of temperature between the sources and the environment is not neglectable: $\Delta T=\SI{200}{\kelvin}$ for the hot source and $\Delta T=\SI{100}{\kelvin}$ for the cold source.
Thus, at the beginning, a huge amount of heat is transfered in a short amount of time which is the reason why power is this high.
When the system is more stabilized, the difference is reduced, but still present.
The sources are kept at their temperature, and heat still flows from one to another with a difference of temperature of $\Delta T=\SI{300}{\kelvin}$.
This leads to a constant power emitted and received from the hot and the cold sources.\\

Another interesting point of this figure is that, after a long time (\SI{0.5}{\second} for example), the sum $P_c + P_f$, respectively the power emitted by the hot source and the power received by the cold source, is equal to the power measured with a surface surrounding both sources, $P_\text{tot}$.
Thus, as both curves seem to converge to the same power, the relation $\lim_{t\rightarrow\infty}P_c(t) + P_f(t) = \lim_{t\rightarrow\infty}P_\text{tot}(t)$ is verified.

\section{Temperature and heat flux with respect to the distance between the bodies}

In this section, the two bodies are brought closer together. To get an optimal curve, the halfway point between the two bodies (0.06,0.05) is chosen, and the bodies are displaced simultaneously closer together, by one grid unit at a time.

The results are displayed on Fig.\ref{fig:e}, where $\Delta x$ is the total displacement of one body. In other words, the distance between the two bodies at any point on the graph is $d = x_c-x_b-2\Delta x$. As the bodies are brought closer, the temperature at the halfway point, which is initially slightly higher than $0$°C, increases logarithmically up to $50$°C, which is the mean temperature of the two bodies $(T_c+T_f)/2$, before the hot body reaches it, at which point its temperature becomes $T_c=200$°C.

The norm of the stationary heat flux increases exponentially as the cold source and the hot source get closer. Indeed, the closer they are, the higher the norm of the spatial gradient of temperature is, as both extremes of temperature get farther from each other and more heat transfer occurs. In fact, as shown on Fig.\ref{fig:e-root}, the heat flux is proportional to the inverse square distance of the two bodies.

\section{Optional}
Fig.\ref{fig:flibre} represents the same simulation as in section \ref{par:heatflux}, with the only difference being that the temperature of the two bodies evolves freely over time. We can observe that the heat of the hot source dissipates, and the cold source is reduced in a similar fashion. Both sources lose their original rectangular shape to take on an ovoïd shape, likely caused by the peak effect discussed in section \ref{par:heatflux}, as the heat flux is stronger on the corners of a rectangle.

\begin{figure}[h]

  \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.45\textwidth}

    \caption{Heat flux}
    \label{fig:fflux}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{Temperature and heat flux with free temperature evolution}
  \label{fig:flibre}
\end{figure}

Fig.\ref{fig:fflux} shows that the heat flux of the system at $t=0.1$ s is stronger on the sides of the hot source. Moreover, it is slightly stronger on its left side than its right side, possibly because the temperature of the boundary on its left side is fixed at $T_b=0$°C, making for a higher temperature gradient than on its right side, where the temperature is freely evolving.

  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{Simulation for N=160 with an total time of \SI{0.02}{\s}}
  \label{fig:fac1}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:fac1} is a simulation for a dense grid (N=160) on a very short amount of time (t=\SI{0.02}{\s}).
The reason why the simulation is so short is because it reaches the limit of stability for $\Delta t=\SI{1e-4}{\s}$.
On figure \ref{fig:fac1-temp}, the result for the temperature does not seem so different from what was studied before.
But figure \ref{fig:fac1-temp-close} gives a closer look to the top-left corner of the hot source, which is interesting.
First, regarding the temperature, a lot of isolated peaks of temperature can be seen.
This time, there is no physical reason behind this sudden changes of temperature, it clearly comes from the numerical simulation.
Also, the direction of the heat flux is disturbed by these isolated peaks, as shown by the arrows.
Simply by dividing the time step by \num{10}, dt=\SI{1e-5}{\s}, the result is almost like the one for $N=40$.
Thus, this simulation shows what happens on the limit of stability of a numerical method.

Figure \ref{fig:fac2} gives a case where both sources are colder than the environment, and where the sources are not kept at their temperature.
The interesting point is that the sources change the temperature between them, which leads to a \textit{central} heat flux.
